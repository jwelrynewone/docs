# Nibiru Chain Documentation

This website is a comprehensive guide on understanding Nibiru.

### What is Nibiru Chain?

**Nibiru** is a sovereign proof-of-stake blockchain, open-source platform, and member of a family of interconnected blockchains that comprise the Cosmos Ecosystem.  A core blockchain scaling challenge is meeting transaction demand without becoming prohibitively expensive for retail traders. The promise of a multi-chain future has drawn interest towards Cosmos as an infinitely scalable solution to this problem. However, the ecosystem currently lacks tools for investing with complex financial positions. 

Nibiru unifies leveraged derivatives trading, spot trading, staking, and bonded liquidity provision into a seamless user experience. Nibiru enables traders on over 40 blockchains to trade with leverage using a suite of composable decentralized applications:

1. **Nibi-Perps**:  A perpetual futures exchange where users can take leveraged exposure and trade on a plethora of assets — completely on-chain, completely non-custodially, and with minimal gas fees. 
2. **Nibi-Swap**: An automated market maker for multichain assets. This application gives users access to swaps, pools, and bonded liquidity gauges.
3. **Nibiru Stablecoin (NUSD)**: A two-token economic model, where NIBI is the staking and utility token for the protocol and NUSD is a capital-efficient, partially collateralized stablecoin for the protocol.

Nibiru is built with the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), accurately prices assets using a system of front-run resistant oracles, and communicates with other Cosmos layer-1 chains using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) protocol.
