# Nibiru Chain Documentation

This website is a comprehensive guide on understanding Nibiru.

### What is Nibiru Chain?

**Nibiru Chain** is a proof-of-stake blockchain and member of a family of interconnected blockchains that comprise the Cosmos Ecosystem. Nibiru powers three main decentralized applications:

- **Nibiru Perpetuals Exchange**: On the perps exchange, users can take leveraged exposure and trade on a plethora of assets: completely on-chain, completely non-custodially, and with minimal gas fees.
- **Nibiru AMM**: An automated market maker for multichain assets. This application gives users access to swaps, pools, and bonded liquidity gauges.
- **Nibiru Stablecoin**: Nibiru employs a two-token economic model, where NIBI is the staking and utility token for the protocol and NUSD is a capital-efficient, partially collateralized algorithmic stablecoin created by the protocol.

Nibiru is built with the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), accurately prices assets using a system of front-run resistant oracles, and communicates with other Cosmos layer-1 chains using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc) protocol.
