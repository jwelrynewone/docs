Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) enables secure and permissionless transfers of funds between blockchains. 

IBC allows cross-chain computation and transfer of arbitrary data. This includes cross-chain smart contract calls, fee payments, NFTs, and fungible token transfers. 

IBC has connected over 40 blockchains

Brought about by the [Stargate upgrade](https://www.figment.io/resources/cosmos-stargate-upgrade-overview), which completed the set of features described in the original Cosmos Whitepaper. 

IBC is not reliant on a multi-sig or centralized bridging solution.
