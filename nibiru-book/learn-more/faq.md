### What is Nibiru?

**Nibiru** is a sovereign proof-of-stake blockchain, open-source platform, and member of a family of interconnected blockchains that comprise the Cosmos Ecosystem. Nibiru unifies leveraged derivatives trading, spot trading, staking, and bonded liquidity provision into a seamless user experience, enabling users of over 40 blockchains to trade with leverage using a suite of composable decentralized applications.

### Why is the protocol called Nibiru?

* [Nibiru (Babylonian astronomy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru\_\(Babylonian\_astronomy\)): Nibiru translates to “crossing” or “point of transition”.
* [Nibiru Cataclysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru\_cataclysm): “... the name ‘Nibiru’ is derived from the works of the ‘ancient astronaut’ writer Zecharia Sitchin and has interpretations Babylonian and Sumerian mythology...“

### How can I get involved?

* You can try out any of the protocols by following the [testnet instructions](../developer-docs/testnet.md).
* Coming soon: You can try out any of the protocols through their corresponding web applications at [app.nibiru.fi](https://app.nibiru.fi).&#x20;

## ❓ — NIBI FAQ

### What is NIBI token used for?

The security of the Nibiru blockchain relies on a set of validators to commit new blocks and participate in Tendermint BFT consensus by brodcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key. Validators stake **NIBI**, the protocol's native token used for gas, governance, and "mining". Users can delegate NIBI to validators that record and verify transactions in exchange for rewards.

### Where can I buy NIBI and NUSD?

You simply need to have a [Keplr wallet](https://www.keplr.app/) to purchase NIBI and NUSD. This will also enable you to move assets between IBC-enabled blockchains. NIBI and NUSD can be purchased from liquidity pools on Nibi-Swap. You can also mint NUSD directly with USDC.

### How is the NUSD supply created?

Users mint NUSD by placing NIBI and any accepted form of collateral (such as USDC) into the system. In return, the protocol mints and gives an equivalent value in NUSD back to the user minus a small transaction fee. Similarly, an NUSD holder can **burn NUSD** in exchange for equivalent value of NIBI and collateral. This process is described in detail on the [Nibiru Stablecoin - NUSD](faq.md) page.

### What is the release schedule of NIBI?

The token release schedule is described in the [Tokenomics page](content/tokenomics/).

### Where can I go to get other questions answered?

The best place to get questions answered quickly is the [Nibiru Discord](https://discord.gg/cCbfXatEYs). For suggestions, issues, and feature requests on specific applications, the team is also response on GitHub: [github.com/NibiruChain](https://github.com/NibiruChain).&#x20;

## ❓ — Validator FAQ

### What is a validator?

Validators are responsible for committing new blocks and participating in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key.

### What does it mean to stake or delegate?

Validators stake NIBI Users can stake without being a validator by delegating NIBI Commission Staking rewards

### How can I become a validator?

There are instructions on how to set up various kinds of nodes in the [developer docs](developer-docs/testnet/). Reach out to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cCbfXatEYs) if you need assistance.
