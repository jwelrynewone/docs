### Funding Payment

Funding payments are regularly scheduled payments between longs and shorts on Nibi-Perps. These payments are meant to converge the price between the derivative contract (mark), or perp, and its underlying asset (index). A time-weighted average price from the virtual pool is taken to compute the mark price. The index price is derived from an oracle. Funding payments are calculated and exchanged between traders every half hour on Nibiru.
