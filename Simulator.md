Solution for the Matrix Simulator





Derivatives 





Collateral —> 10000 OSMO



Mint —> USDM 



OSMO PRICE = 10



Matrix = 100,000 USD vol



LA = 10,000 USD —> leverage = 10



Major incentive of the LA to come to the Matrix protocol is —> they can go long a perp with zero funding rate….



OSMO goes to 15 $



PROTOCOL PNL : 50,000 USD



LA : 10,000 -> 100% pnl  & IF =  40,000 —> incentive pendulum —> ***governance token would vote for the split



PERP = 1 leverage 10 *** FEES non linear function —> IF



IA : over-collateteralize —> yield from the matrix protocol….





Market goes down the LAs would not come to the protocol…..



Derivative protocol : 



IF would take the short side and pay the LAs a funding rate in the down-term 



Every hour there is a funding rate of 100 bps —> IF pays that (Matrix protocol) —> funding rate —> funding rate model —> make the LAs lose 30-40% of their money rather than 100%



OSMO price = 9$



Protocol exposure = 90,000$



10% -> 6 hours 



t_1 = 100,000 * 100 * 1e-4 = 1000

t_2 = 1000

….

t_6 = 1000



================================



LAs = -4000 or 40%
